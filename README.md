# video-dataset-scripts

Tooling for image generation datasets is well established, with [`img2dataset`](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) covering large scale and various community guides, scripts and UIs covering the small scale.

Our goal is to make tooling for video generation datasets as established by creating open video dataset scripts suited for small scale, with [`video2dataset`](https://github.com/iejMac/video2dataset) covering large scale.

The repository consists of the tooling we are developing to make it easy for the community to build their own datasets for fine-tuning video generation models. Check out our introduction [blog post](https://github.com/huggingface/blog/pull/2631/) here to learn more and head to the [`video_processing`](./video_processing) directory to get started.

We plan to keep this repository easy to follow along and nimble.
